<p>
  A final year project for my Robotics & Vision module, where I designed, developed and implemented a software solution to make a robot (Turtlebot) scan the surroundings of the environment to search for images pinned to the wall and recognise them, with the final goal of playing the famour game Cluedo with a robotic twist.

The complete source code and videos of the working solution can be found in the respective repo on my github:
