        <p>Hey there, <strong>my name is Ilyass</strong> and I am a Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/the-university" target="_blank">University of Bonn</a>, where I am specializing in Robotics. I also spent six months working at the <a href="https://iit.it/" target="_blank">Italian Institute of Technology</a> on Computer Vision, and another six months at <a href="https://fotokite.com/" target="_blank">Fotokite</a> as an Engineering Intern. I am currently interested in everything that rotates around <strong>Robotics</strong> and <strong>Computer Vision</strong>. I am currently working on vision algorithms for quadrupedal robots at the AIS group in Bonn. Oh yeah, my wildest dream is to <strong>Spacewalk</strong>.</p>
