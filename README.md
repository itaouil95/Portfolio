# **Portfolio**

This is the repo where I will be developing and storing my personal website (THANKS JEKYLL AND GITHUB).

I will be documenting the development process starting from the beginning and working it way through until it is finished.

Let's get started:

### **Requisites**

I will be using jekyll which is a static website generator, that takes all of my plain texts and transforms them into a website. Moreover, jekyll offers free hosting on GITHUB, and this is definitely a plus.

A static portfolio is what fits best with my needs in the occasion so I am going with that, however, I would like to point out some interesting pros of using static webpages:

1. No dependencies like databases of third party scripting.
2. As there are no dependencies, this means there is less maintenance to do which is always great.
3. Better performance for end users (clients), given the first two points.

Jekyll, moreover, offers a modular and structured way for your projects. As you have the chance to break the webpage into modular component and include them into the main file (bundling).
